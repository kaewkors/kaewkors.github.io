        <p>1. Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.<br><br>

        Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.<br>
        As a barista; I always have to deal with dairy, gluten or other special dietary contained products.<br>
        I've often got asked for dairy free drinks i.e soy, almond milk.<br><br>

        During the busy time, there is high chance of using wrong jugs or contaminated, etc.<br>
        To prevent the misused, at good cafes' we try to come up with color tape around the milk jug handle.<br>
        I personally keep the jugs seperately from the dairy ones for instance, leave in the fridge or on the different bench.<br><br>

        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,<br>
        the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.<br>
        For me, handling the right order to clients is not only dealing with allergens but it is about customer service mindset as well,<br>
        and this what makes them repeatedly come back for the service again.<br><br>
        
        Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.<br>
        I'm from Thailand in the (South East) Asia continent, my culture focuses on collectivism and family oriented.<br>
        I need to admit that, because of my role in hospitality plus my own values and identity, I do care the clients like my family members.</p><br><br><br>
        
        <p>2. Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.<br><br>

        Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.<br>
        I value respectfulness and punctuality, because I feel that time is vital for me and everyone.<br><br>
                
        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.<br>
        When there are times that I show up late, I always make sure the other party aware of that.<br><br>

        Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.<br>
        As mention earlier, being empathy to others which I've got from the culture <br>
        has easily influenced me and makes me become myself like today.<br><br>
        
        Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development<br>
        Since I have low level of creativity and ambitious, I do not really set goal in career or for myself in general.<br>
        However, I like to talk to people and communication and think that if I surround with people<br>
        who specialise in different areas would help me elevate myself in some ways.<br><br>
        
        Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.<br>
        Although I have a positive/ can-do attitude and growth mindset, I need to really work more on discipline to overcome my learning obstrucles.<br>
        
        <!Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.>
        

        <!Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.>

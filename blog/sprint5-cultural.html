      <h1>Reflection</h1>

      <p class="question">What are three new things you have learned about yourself
        and your ego as a result of the core learning?
      </p> 

        <p class="answer">I have learned that 1)anyone can be trained and able to have growth mindset,
          </br>it's not rocket science but it requires time, patience and effort to earn effective outcome.
          </br>2)I appreciate to recieve feedback from people around me more.
          </br>3)Not knowing everything doesn't mean I fail,
          </br>but be able to apply just in time learning and use it wisely is more vital.
        </p>

      
      <p class="question">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
      </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Values: 
          Empathy: I would think of empathy in terms of writing clean, clear and understandable code, for your teammates or your future self.
          Self-awareness: Know and treat what your mental needs as good as your physical.
        </p>


      <p class="question">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </p>
        <p class="answer">How mindfulness help me a lot during the time in foundation,
          </br>when I fele stress out or had no idea what to deal with my mentality
        </p>
      

      <p class="question">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        <p class="answer">
          The Reflections part; I wasn't sure what to reflect after each sprint exercises, but with more practises I hope to getting better.
        </p>


      <p class="question">Why do you think we, a programming school,
        are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        <p class="answer">
          To be able to success in any career, personal skills are key and essential.
          </br>
        </p>


        <p class="question">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
        </br>Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </p>
      

      <p class="answer">
          I don't think that wastes time at all, I enjoy the core skills.
          </br>It's as important skills as technical skills, not only for workwise but even for general living
        </p>

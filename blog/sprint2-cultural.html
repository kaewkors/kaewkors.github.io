                Strengths: Once I concentrated, I never leave the site until I found the answer.<br>
                Also I never think of giving up, plus difficulty is challenging and allows me learn more.<br><br>

                Limitations: Easily get distracted from either internal and external factors i.e. my own thoughts, open too many browsers during the tutorial.<br>
                Did not keep up with the recommended time.
